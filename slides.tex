	\frametitle{The Allegations}
	The \emph{Serverless} ethos is a response to alleged shortcomings of traditional
	web apps:
	\begin{itemize}
		\pause \item Patching servers is hard.
		\pause \item Scaling servers is hard.
		\pause \item Money spent on idle VMs is wasted.
	\end{itemize}
	\pause
	We'll accept these claims for the moment, because they motivate Lambda's design.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Some Skepticism}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If your team is bad at these, will a new platform will be easier?
		\pause \item If you are willing to learn Serverless, why not UNIX?
	\end{itemize}

	You can't imagine how disappointed I was to find out that they \emph{didn't} fix
	User Namespaces.
